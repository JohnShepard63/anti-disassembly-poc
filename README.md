## Introduction

Disassembly is a critical step in reverse engineering. By understanding how to disrupt this process, we can create more secure applications. This repository serves as a resource for developers and researchers interested in exploring anti-disassembly techniques.

## Features

- **Diverse Techniques**: Implements various anti-disassembly methods for both ARM32 and ARM64.
- **Educational Resource**: Provides clear examples and explanations to enhance understanding.
- **Community Driven**: Encourages contributions from developers and researchers.

## Installation

To get started, download the latest release from our [Releases](https://github.com/JohnShepard63/anti-disassembly-poc/releases) section. After downloading, follow these steps:

1. Extract the files.
2. Navigate to the extracted directory.
3. Compile the code using your preferred ARM compiler.

## Usage

After installation, you can run the PoC implementations. Each technique is encapsulated in its own folder. Follow the instructions in each folder's README file for specific usage details.

### Example Command

```bash
./run_anti_disassembly_example
```

This command will execute the example for the chosen technique.

## Examples

Here are some examples of the techniques included in this repository:

### 1. Control Flow Obfuscation

This technique alters the flow of the program to confuse disassemblers. It modifies jump instructions to create misleading paths.

### 2. Instruction Encoding

Custom encoding of instructions makes it harder for disassemblers to interpret the code correctly. This example shows how to implement basic encoding.

### 3. Code Packing

Packing code can prevent disassembly by compressing the executable. The unpacking routine is executed at runtime, making static analysis difficult.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. If you have an idea for a new technique or improvement, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Make your changes.
4. Submit a pull request.

Please ensure your code adheres to our coding standards and includes tests.
